description: Understanding why if..else isn't possible with FHE and exploring the alternatives
---

Writing code with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) introduces a fundamental shift in how we handle conditionals or branches in our code. As you already know, with FHE, we're operating on encrypted data. This means we can't use typical `if...else` branching structures, because we don't have visibility into the actual values we're comparing.

Instead, use the `select` function which works like a ternary operator (`condition ? "yes" : "no"`) but for encrypted values.

## Quick Example

```sol
euint32 a = FHE.asEuint32(10);
euint32 b = FHE.asEuint32(20);
euint32 max;

// Instead of this (won't work) :
if (a.gt(b)) { // gt returns encrypted boolean (ebool)
   max = a;
} else {
   max = b;
}

// Do this : 
ebool isHigher = a.gt(b);
max = FHE.select(isHigher, a, b);
```

When writing Solidity contracts with our FHE capabilities, you'll need to consider all possible branches of a conditional at the same time. It's somewhat akin to writing constant-time cryptographic code, where you want to avoid timing attacks that could leak information about secret data.

To handle these conditionals, we use a concept called a "selector".
A selector is a function that takes in a control and two branches, and returns the result of the branch that corresponds to the condition. A selector is like a traffic signal that decides which traffic to let through based on the color of the light (control signal).

In Fhenix, we utilize this by calling the `select` function. It's a function that takes in a condition and two inputs, and returns the input that corresponds to the state of the condition. You can think of this like a ternary boolean conditional (`condition ? "yes" : "no"`), but for encrypted data.

In the example above, `FHE.select` uses the encrypted `ebool` result of `gt`, so if `isHigher` is true (encrypted true, not a plaintext one), it returns `a`, otherwise, it returns `b`.

## Key Points to Remember

- All operations take place on encrypted data, so the actual values and comparison results stay concealed
- The `select` function is the only way to handle conditional execution in FHE
- This pattern maintains privacy without sacrificing functionality
- It's similar to constant-time programming patterns

## Common Use Cases

Here are some common scenarios where you'll use `select`:

1. **Maximum/Minimum Operations**
```sol
euint32 max = FHE.select(a.gt(b), a, b);
```

2. **Conditional Updates**
```sol
euint32 newValue = FHE.select(shouldUpdate, newValue, currentValue);
```

3. **Threshold Checks**
```sol
ebool isAboveThreshold = value.gt(threshold);
euint32 result = FHE.select(isAboveThreshold, value, threshold);
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use `select` instead of trying to implement branching logic. Using traditional `if..else` might result in **unexpected behaviour**
2. Keep your conditional logic simple and linear
3. Remember that all operations must be performed on encrypted data
4. Consider the performance implications of complex conditional chains
