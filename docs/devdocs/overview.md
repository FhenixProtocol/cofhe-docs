# Overview
This is my version!!!
Welcome to the CoFHE documentation. This section provides a comprehensive overview of CoFHE.
CoFHE is Fhenix's FHE CoProcessor that enables confidential operations on EVM chains. dApps can use CoFHE to integrate encrypted data into their solidity smart contracts and perform confidential operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication which allows for confidential transactions, private voting and many more.

## What is CoFHE
CoFhe, an FHE enabled coprocessor, is a privacy tool for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains that allows computation directly on encrypted data. It means your smart contracts can handle sensitive information (like bids, votes, or user data) without ever exposing it to the network. CoFhe works off-chain, so it’s fast and scalable, and its stateless design makes integration as easy as adding a single solidity library. Whether you're building in DeFi, DAOs, or Gaming, CoFhe adds encrypted data handling to your contracts while keeping them lightweight and performant.
