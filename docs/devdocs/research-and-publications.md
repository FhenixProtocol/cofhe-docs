## Research in Fhenix

Our research at Fhenix focuses on designing and implementing robust, high-performance cryptographic protocols for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Key efforts center on optimizing FHE-based smart contracts and advancing **COPHE**â€”a co-processor built specifically to handle complex FHE operations efficiently.

## Current Project: Threshold Decryption for FHE

Based on our latest work in threshold FHE decryption (see attached publication), we are developing a high-throughput, UC-secure protocol that removes ciphertext noise via efficient multi-party computation. This approach eliminates the need for noise flooding and substantially improves performance while maintaining strong composability and simulation-based security.
