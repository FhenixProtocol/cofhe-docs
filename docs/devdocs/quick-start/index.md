# CoFHE Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the CoFHE Quick Start Guide! This guide will take you through a carefully designed learning path to build privacy-preserving applications using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

## Your Learning Path

We've designed this Quick Start section as a progressive journey from fundamentals to application:

### 1. Local Development Setup

First, you'll set up a local development environment to build and test your FHE applications.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to set up a complete local Fhenix environment with the cofhe-hardhat-starter kit
- Understanding key components: cofhe-hardhat-plugin, cofhejs, and cofhe-mock-contracts
- Writing and testing FHE smart contracts using mock environments
- Deploying to Sepolia testnets for more realistic testing

The Fhenix development environment provides everything you need to develop, test, and deploy FHE contracts both locally and on Fhenix test networks.

→ [Set Up Local Development](/docs/devdocs/quick-start/local-development)

### 2. Your First FHE Contract

Next, you'll build a simple encrypted counter contract to understand FHE on the smart contract side.

**What you'll learn:**

- How to define and work with encrypted data types
- Performing operations on encrypted values
- Access control and permissions
- Asynchronous decryption process

→ [Build Your First FHE Contract](/docs/devdocs/quick-start/Your-First-FHE-Contract)

### 3. Getting Started with Cofhejs

Next, you'll learn how to use the JavaScript SDK to interact with FHE-enabled contracts.

**What you'll learn:**

- The mental model behind encrypted data processing
- How to set up cofhejs in your project
- Core operations: encryption, permits, and unsealing
- Local development environment configuration

→ [Begin with Cofhejs Setup](/docs/devdocs/quick-start/getting-started)

### 4. Best Practices

Finally, learn how to write secure and efficient FHE code.

**What you'll learn:**

- Security considerations for FHE
- Performance optimization techniques

→ [Apply Best Practices](/docs/devdocs/quick-start/best-practices)

## Next Steps After Quick Start

Once you've completed the Quick Start, continue your learning journey with:

- [Complete Cofhejs Documentation](/docs/category/cofhejs) - Deep dive into the JavaScript SDK
- [FHE Library Reference](/docs/devdocs/fhe-library) - Learn about core FHE operations
- [Solidity API Reference](/docs/devdocs/solidity-api/FHE.md) - Complete reference for the Solidity library
- [Advanced Tutorials](/docs/category/tutorials) - Learn how to add FHE to existing contracts
